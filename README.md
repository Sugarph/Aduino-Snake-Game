# Arduino Snake Game

This is a project for the Programming Internet of Things subject.  
A simple snake game that is played using buttons, and the score is displayed on a 7-segment display (max score of 9).

**Note**: I don't have the MAX7219 so there aren't enough pins on a single board to control the 8x8 LED matrix and display the score, I am using 2 Arduino Uno boards for this project.

## Components Needed:
- 2 Arduino Uno 3 boards
- 8x8 Matrix LED display
- 2 Buttons
- 7-segment display

## Wiring Diagram:
⚠️ **WARNING**: <span style="color:red">**DO NOT**</span> connect any power to the receiver board ⚠️
